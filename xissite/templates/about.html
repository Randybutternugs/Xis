    <p style="margin: 2% 10% 2% 10%;">We are an agricultural technology company focused on the development of accessible, data-driven, and efficient hydroponics systems. We have developed a comprehensive electronics suite responsible for automating the growing process while gathering data neglected by most US grow operations.</br></br> Data inputs like electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen content, ambient temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, water temperature, light levels, total dissolved solids, acidity, and more, enable the user to obtain a comprehensive analysis of the plant's surroundings and growing conditions in a way that has never been offered before. Our system aggregates these data points and utilizes Artificial Intelligence to deduce the best course of action to maintain optimal health and conditions. This direct feedback to the cultivator, from our system, takes the guesswork out of farming and drastically reduces overhead in commercial farm operations. </br></br> The material composition of our tower unit and subcomponents is polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), a natural, biodegradable biomaterial that can decompose in normal, natural soil conditions. So, no microplastics, nylons or toxic leeching chemicals can taint the plants growing in our systems. The net cups we manufacture are a copper-nanocomposite that will aid in mitigating biotic factors like disease and algae growth by passively sanitizing the water. Material composition matters. </br></br> Additionally, we offer a solution to the ever-present issue of getting bioavailable silicone into liquid fertilizer. We offer a grow medium that delivers water-soluble bioavailable silica which strengthens plant cell walls and improves resistance to biotic and abiotic factors alike. </br></br> Our towers are modular, easy to maintain, and built for both performance and simplicity. We intend to empower growers with sustainable, data-driven systems that deliver healthier, high-quality plants, higher yields, and to reduce overhead, increase yield, and make farms what they ought to be in this day and age. </br></br></p>
